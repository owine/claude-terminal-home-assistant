# OPTIONAL WORKFLOW: Claude Code Automated PR Review
#
# This workflow automatically reviews pull requests using Claude Code's AI analysis.
#
# How it works:
# 1. PR is opened, updated, or marked ready for review
# 2. Claude Code analyzes the diff, code quality, and potential issues
# 3. Provides inline comments and suggestions
# 4. Checks for common mistakes, security issues, and best practices
#
# Requirements:
# - CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN secret configured in repository settings
# - Active Claude Code subscription
#
# This is NOT required for the add-on to function. It's a development productivity
# tool that can be disabled without affecting the core project.
#
# Configuration:
# - allowed_bots: 'renovate' - Also reviews Renovate dependency PRs
# - Can be customized to filter by PR author or file paths
#
# See: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action
