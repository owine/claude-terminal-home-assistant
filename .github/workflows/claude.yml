# OPTIONAL WORKFLOW: Claude Code Comment Automation
#
# This workflow enables AI-assisted development by responding to @claude mentions
# in GitHub issues, pull requests, and comments.
#
# How it works:
# 1. User mentions @claude in an issue or PR comment
# 2. Claude Code CLI analyzes the context (code, issue, PR diff)
# 3. Claude responds with suggestions, code fixes, or answers
#
# Requirements:
# - CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN secret configured in repository settings
# - Active Claude Code subscription
#
# This is NOT required for the add-on to function. It's a development productivity
# tool that can be disabled without affecting the core project.
#
